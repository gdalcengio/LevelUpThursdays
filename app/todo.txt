            - [ ] does Validation
            - [ ] throws User save sighting failure if doesn't pass Validation
            - [ ] puts User save sighting success with updated state if pass, that action hits reducer
        - [ ] Write to disk - this gets fired on User save sighting success

today todo:

- [x] MW: Save button & handler code all working and page that lists sightings working as expected
- [ ] J: API integration:
        - [ ] Update OpenAPI Spec for endpoint to accept a list of sightings from a client
        - [ ] Make a side effect function client side to call API with matching interface data and get a 200
        - [ ] Update API http handler to do the database stuff we need (and any db subtasks)
        - [ ] All happens on button click, user sees if it worked or not

        Misc UX improvements:
- [ ] Need a home button
- [ ] Footer on sightings page needs to be stuck on bottom
- [ ] snackbars for successful save / api events
    - [ ] state array with notifications
    - [ ] action to dispatch to add to array
    - [ ] snackbar component to alert user of events (like 'saved', 'synched' 'error trying to submit something')
    - [ ] action to remove notification from array (user hits clear, or on first render its gonna be dispatched with a timeout or something)

React leaflet stuff:
- [ ] User can see all sightings on map, not just the current one
    - [ ] component to show all sightings
    - [ ] they are different colour depending on sync, current sighting, etc
    - [ ] Bonus goal - layer toggles

- [ ] User can clear their map or delete individual sightings (that haven't been synced)
    - [x] N: User can clear current sighting
